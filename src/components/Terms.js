          10. How #ZeroContracts Work
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          At SaveTheWorldWithArt.io, we offer two versions of our smart contracts, known as <strong>#ZeroContracts</strong>, designed to simplify the process of creating and managing your NFT collections on the Tezos blockchain. Here's how each version works:
        </Typography>

        {/* ZeroContract Version 1 */}
        <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
          ZeroContract Version 1
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          **Version 1** is tailored for artists who want to create a limited edition of 1/1 NFTs. This means each NFT is unique and cannot be replicated. The primary entrypoints (functions) available in this contract are:
        </Typography>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>mint:</strong> Allows you to create a new NFT by providing its metadata and specifying the recipient's address.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>burn:</strong> Enables you to permanently remove an NFT from circulation by specifying its unique identifier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>balance_of:</strong> Lets you check the ownership balance by querying the contract with specific requests and receiving callbacks with the relevant information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>transfer:</strong> Facilitates the transfer of NFTs from one address to another, ensuring seamless ownership changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>update_operators:</strong> Allows you to manage permissions by adding or removing operators who can handle your NFTs on your behalf.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* ZeroContract Version 2 */}
        <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
          ZeroContract Version 2
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          **Version 2** is designed for artists who wish to mint multiple editions of their NFTs, offering greater flexibility. The entrypoints in this version include all those in Version 1, with additional functionalities to support multiple editions:
        </Typography>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>add_child / add_parent:</strong> Manage hierarchical relationships between contracts, allowing for complex NFT structures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>balance_of:</strong> Similar to Version 1, it provides ownership balance information based on specific requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>burn:</strong> Permanently removes a specified quantity of NFTs based on their unique identifiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>mint:</strong> Creates new NFTs with provided metadata and assigns them to a specified address, supporting multiple editions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>transfer:</strong> Enables the transfer of multiple NFTs between addresses, ensuring efficient ownership management.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>update_operators:</strong> Allows for the addition or removal of operators who can manage NFTs on your behalf.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* Explanation of Metadata and On-Chain NFTs */}
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          **Metadata Storage:**  
          All the information about your NFTs, such as their names, descriptions, creators, and images, is stored directly on the Tezos blockchain. This ensures that your NFTs are fully on-chain, making them immutable and secure.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          **On-Chain NFTs:**  
          By deploying your NFTs on-chain, you ensure that they exist permanently and transparently on the blockchain. This provides a trustworthy record of ownership and provenance, enhancing the value and authenticity of your artwork.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          **Collection Thumbnails:**  
          The thumbnail images representing your NFT collection are also stored on-chain as part of the metadata. To ensure optimal performance and compatibility with platforms like OBJKT.com, thumbnails are compressed and kept under 20KB in size.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          **Automated, No-Code Deployment:**  
          Our platform automates the complex process of deploying smart contracts and minting NFTs, providing a user-friendly, no-code experience. This empowers artists to effortlessly bring their creations to the blockchain without requiring technical expertise.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>

          Dive into a fascinating world where art meets blockchain technology. Our platform supports various art forms, including compressionism and pixel art, allowing you to showcase your unique style on the Tezos network.
